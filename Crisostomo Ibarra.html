          <td>Crisostomo was born into the Ibarra family and reared by his father Don Rafael in San Diego. As a boy, he became acquainted with Maria Clara. He departed to study in Europe in 1874, and while he was gone, Don Rafael and Capitan Tiago married him to Maria Clara. He returned after seven years after learning of his father's death.</td>

          <td>Ibarra was a young man who was sincere and idealistic. He desired to develop the country, influenced by his European education; as part of this, he believed in the potential of education to implement reforms and worked to construct a school in San Diego to that aim. Ibarra believed in the welfare of all people and was unconscious of his opponents as part of his idealism. Despite this, Ibarra argued that some types of tyranny, such as the brutal Guardia Civil, were necessary for society to operate.

          As the son of an affluent family, Ibarra carried himself with correct manners and made an effort to be pleasant to everyone. He wasn't beyond violating the rules if it meant protecting his father's memory or saving someone's life. He may also be irritated by anyone who disobeyed his desires.</td>
